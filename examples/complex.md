# Meeting / reviews / correspondance

## ``02/07/2020 6:00am``

Spent the last few days installing and looking over rails, tried manually installing dependencies, tried removing version restrictions, etc., to no avail. There are |around 1000 dependencies, which must be sucking down huge (huge) amounts of memory| which I would assume cripples even the largest server's ability to deal with any sort of anomaly. This needs more research, including:

- what is the dependency map? I'd like to use an analysis tool like [graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org/), especially a gem [gem depenedencies visualizer](http://patshaughnessy.net/2011/9/17/bundlers-best-kept-secret). Pending no success there, I may have to resort to a homemade ^^svg^^ chart or something.
- Looking at another one called [rubrowser](https://github.com/emad-elsaid/rubrowser) that renders some html output of a program structure
- A Medium article on [visualizing domain model](https://medium.com/@gbardhoshi/visualizing-your-domain-model-in-rails-4b483648516) in rails

It should be stated, I've tried to use a lot of analysis tools thus far, but because the dependency chains are in conflict, bundler exiting unsuccessfully.

I've been looking at the {MongoDB} data (obviously installing and [downloading a recent backup](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/mongo-db-backup?project=mca-chicago-production)) and am still getting reacquainted with it's techniques as well as the integration with the {MCA} application

## ``02/05/2020 2:00pm``

Per email discussion, updates pending on {tc} deployment instructions. {as} asked if I could start instances on {GCP} (I can, and did start a micro [here](http://35.223.240.212) for the time being). Also pointed me to the spot in the documentation and storage buckets for the mongo backups.

## ``02/04/2020 6:00am``

I've been reviewing the documentation provide including Onix pdf, the README's in GitHub as well as the wiki. I need to request access to a few more things eventually:

- Jenkins CI [found here](http://104.197.216.8:8080/login?from=%2F)
- Google Analytics


## ``01/29/2020 2:00pm``

Met with {as} at Marisol to exchange contract and tax documents. On the agenda was:

- Having {tc} attempt a fresh install of the {MCA} application using new git credentials and a blank dev environment
- Discussed developing a dev environment to house the auditing process as well as connect various apis and run skeleton applications
- Revisited topics regarding the Google cloud platform
- learned about [teach.mcachicago.org](https://teach.mcachicago.org/institute/) as another domain that is hosted

## ``01/21/2020 9:30am``

Met {ls} and {as} for first meeting to to discuss agenda of the auditing process. 

One question I asked during conversation was if there was an "origin story" of the current website implementation—which I've dubbed version 2 due assuming there was a version prior. It's unclear if version 1 or anything before exists in terms of code ([screenshot here](media/images/mcachicago-06-02-2015-screenshot.jpg))—but there is nothing known of at this point beyond the initial proposal for the current site in place.

Conversed about the state of identifying errors and shutdowns when they occur, and if the causes were well understood. It seems while they are somewhat predictable, the root causes were still somewhat murky.

### Goals (ordered by timeliness)
- in 3-4 Weeks (Around ``01/21/2020 +3.5 weeks``) check-in with stronger expectations
- try to meaningfully document how things can/will/have improve with efforts begun here
- develop interesting use-cases that can offer potential for buy-in
- make case for new platforms in terms of how much time/money/energy/etc. they might save
- year one goal is to clean house

I've started authoring a file called `model.xml` which will be supplemented with information I gather as process continues (roles, utilization of technology, etc.) that can be parsed and compiled in myriad ways according to any reporting needed.

### ^^TODO^^ for interval one completion

Interval one will adhere to the interval outlined in the [original proposal](media/docs/MCA-proposal-brendan_metzger.pdf): **Determine a way of documenting and sharing the information to be generated by the MCA assessment process; acquire access to necessary technical systems and accounts; produce a skeleton outline of needs to be addressed.**

#### ^^MCA^^ will attend to

- [ ] necessary introductions for {bm}
- [x] provide contract
- {as} will provide some resources
  - [ ] provide copy of the accessibility audit
  - [x] login to Google Cloud platform
  - [ ] In-house web audit re. staff needs/roles
----
#### {bm} will attend to

- [x] Compile notes from meeting minutes from ``01/21/2020`` meeting
- [ ] Compile notes from previous emails
- [x] Construct methods of documentation and information sharing
- [ ] Determine and list automations used throughout site
- [x] Build a skeleton outline of needs to be addressed

## Final note on parsing

```
   this is some fenced code, it will go in a pre tag
   
   anything in it will show up, I think.
   
   these new lines will be problematic.
```

> Blockquotes should be rendered with a citation, but I'm not sure the syntax that makes that easiest to author

## why not here?

1. an ordered list should work ok
2. let's see!
